# The Code 

```javascript
function calculator() {
  // I'll get the operation from the second element of process.argv
  const operation = process.argv[2];
  // Get the numbers from the rest of the elements in process.argv
  const numbers = process.argv.slice(3);

  // Check if an operation was provided or not sensei anthony wise words!
  if (!operation) {
    return "No operation provided...";
  }
  // Check if numbers were provided
  if (!numbers.length) {
    return "No numbers provided...";
  }
  // Check if the operation is valid (either "plus" or "minus")
  if (operation !== "plus" && operation !== "minus") {
    return `Invalid operation: ${operation}`;
  }

  let result = Number(numbers[0]);
  for (let i = 1; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    // If operation is "plus", add the current number to the result
    if (operation === "plus") {
      result += Number(numbers[i]);
    }
    // If operation is "minus", subtract the current number from the result
    else if (operation === "minus") {
      result -= Number(numbers[i]);
    }
  }
  // Return the final result
  return result;
}

```

## Why the code works step by step

1. This code defines a function called calculator(). When the function is called, it performs the following steps:

2. It retrieves the operation from the second element of the process.argv array. The process.argv array contains command line arguments passed to the Node.js script. The operation is expected to be passed as the second argument, with the first argument being the name of the script.

3. It retrieves the numbers to be used in the calculation from the remaining elements of the process.argv array using slice() method.

4. It checks if an operation was provided or not and if not it will return "No operation provided..."

5. It checks if numbers were provided and if not it will return "No numbers provided..."

6. It checks if the operation is valid (either "plus" or "minus") and if not it will return a string with the invalid operation

7. It initializes a variable result with the first number provided in the numbers array and converts it to a number using Number()

8. It starts a loop that iterates through the remaining elements of the numbers array, starting at the second element.

9. In the loop, it checks if the operation is "plus" or "minus".

10. If the operation is "plus", it adds the current number to the result.

11. If the operation is "minus", it subtracts the current number from the result.

12. After the loop, it returns the final result.

Note that the function does not handle any errors or cases where the provided arguments are not valid numbers.


```javascript
// Call the calculator function with command line arguments
// The first argument is the name of the script,
// the second argument is the operation ("plus" or "minus"),
// and the remaining arguments are the numbers to be used in the calculation
console.log(calculator("node", "index.js", "plus", "3", "4", "5"));

```
* Redid it for better understanding after having it looked over and explained by a friend.

```javascript
function calculator() {
    // Get the operation from the second element of the arguments array
    const operation = process.argv[2];
    // Get the numbers from the rest of the elements in the arguments array
    const numbers = process.argv.slice(3);
    // Check if an operation was provided
    if (!operation) {
        return "No operation provided...";
    }
    // Check if numbers were provided
    if (!numbers.length) {
        return "No numbers provided...";
    }
    // Check if the operation is valid (either "plus" or "minus")
    if (operation !== "plus" && operation !== "minus") {
        return `Invalid operation: ${operation}`;
    }
    //initialize the result variable with the first number 
    let result = Number(numbers[0]);
    //loop through the remaining numbers
    for (let i = 1; i < numbers.length; i++) {
        // If operation is "plus", add the current number to the result
        if (operation === "plus") {
            result += Number(numbers[i]);
        }
        // If operation is "minus", subtract the current number from the result
        else if (operation === "minus") {
            result -= Number(numbers[i]);
        }
    }
    // Return the final result
    return result;
}

```

* In this example, the function is called with the command line arguments "node", "calculator.js", "plus", "3", "4", "5". The first argument is the name of the script, the second argument is the operation ("plus"), and the remaining arguments are the numbers to be used in the calculation. The function will return the result 12, which is the sum of 3, 4, and 5.
